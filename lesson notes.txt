- For new joiners terms are thrown in the module without explanation, these are not frequently used terms outside of crypto.
    - Epoch: On the very first page. 
	- Ledger: Lesson 3/9 module 1
- We talk about how Solana is faster then Ethereum. Is it also cheaper electricity wise? A lot of people who are against blockchains use arguments like a transaction uses X watt or something. Curious if this is true and if so universal between chains
	- Oeh, proof of stake in module after. This may already answer this. Proof of stake decreases electricty by 95%
- Gonna be mean here: Don't get me wrong. I love your enthousiasm and voice, You're a great presenter. But in my opinion adding some more frame around the presenter would be good. it feels a bit too close.

Solana is a level 1 blockchain, what does this mean?
Answered later:
	A block chain is technology which makes it possible to record information an a reliable way
	We are layer one since Solana is a base layer which validates everything. this means there's extra features/security. Other example would be Ethereum
  - This makes me wonder, a guy earlier this week showed a video of token vs coin where a coin has its own chain. Are coins level 2 blockchains? Or are they still just entities upon the Solana blockchain.

Areas of interest:
Defi project: Orca, cause I'm curious about options of automatic interaction with this
https://solana.com/ecosystem/orca
NFT project: Metaplex, heard a lot about metaplex protocols
https://solana.com/ecosystem/metaplex?categories=nft
Application: Genopets, it's the app my crypto interest sparks from. Didn't find it listed though

What's exciting about Solana to me:
I'm involved in a crypto project where I'm the main pull behind a bot. Would like to add features that use web3 logic.
I also am curious about learning Rust, have been for quite some time but haven't had a good use case to inspire the time investment hope this will help
It's a whole new world with both data analysis, calculation in the shape of programs and more which I'm curious to explore
